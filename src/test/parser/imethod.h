/* The interface to input methods.
 *
 * The paradigm is that the main line calls the input method each time
 * it wants an input packet.  If the input method gets the packets
 * from a source that returns multiple packets at once, it has to
 * buffer them (which it can do with a private data structure, set up
 * by init and passed to readpkt).
 */

/* Returned values from readpkt methods.  The intended semantics are:
 *	PARSER_TEST_RP_GOOD		A good packet.
 *	PARSER_TEST_RP_OVF		A `packet' which overflows the buffer.
 *	PARSER_TEST_RP_EOF		No more input.
 *	PARSER_TEST_RP_ERR		Some error occurred.
 *  In the PARSER_TEST_RP_ERR case, it is the readpkt method's responsibility
 *  to print a suitable error message to stderr before returning.
 */

	PARSER_TEST_RP_GOOD = 1,
	PARSER_TEST_RP_OVF,
	PARSER_TEST_RP_EOF,
	PARSER_TEST_RP_ERR,
};

/* An input method.
 *
 * name is the text name, for the command line and error messages.
 *
 * help is expected to print help; this is used by -i help,<name>.
 *
 * init is passed the ARGS string from the command line, or nil if not
 * even the comma was given. It is expected to parse the parameters
 * and either return a void pointer which is passed to readpkt and
 * done calls, or complain to stderr and exit. (The void * is opaque
 * to everything except the input method). If the input method needs
 * to keep some kind of state - buffering, settings, whatever - the
 * way to do it is for init to allocate a private state struct and
 * return a pointer to it. readpkt and done then get that pointer
 * passed back to them.
 *
 * readpkt is called when the main program wants to read a(nother)
 * input packet. It is passed the the cookie from init, the buffer
 * pointer, the size of the buffer, and an int * through which it
 * should store the actual size of the packet. (It is an error for
 * the size stored to be less than zero or greater than the buffer
 * size). It returns an enum rprv (see above) indicating what
 * kind of result it had; PARSER_TEST_RP_GOOD is the only one where it
 * is expected to provide packet data and length through the second and
 * fourth arguments, but it is harmless (if perhaps inefficient) for to
 * write through the packet buffer and length pointers in other cases,
 * provided of course that it does not write to packet data beyond the
 * specified maximum length.
 *
 * done is called to clean up before exiting. This is not, strictly,
 * necessary, since exiting cleans up most things. This exists both
 * in case there is something (like a temporary file in the
 * filesystem) that needs more cleaning up and to make it easier to
 * wrap this code in things that don't just exit when they're done.
