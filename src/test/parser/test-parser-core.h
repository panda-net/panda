/* A computation core.
 *
 * name is the text name, for the command line and error messages.
 *
 * help is expected to print help; this is used by -c help,<name>.
 *
 * init is passed the ARGS string from the command line, or NULL if not
 * even the comma was given. It is expected to parse the parameters
 * and either return a void pointer which is passed to process and
 * done calls, or print to sdderr and exit. (The void * is opaque
 * to everything except the core). If the core needs to keep some
 * kind of state - buffering, settings, whatever - the way to do it is
 * for init to allocate a private state struct and return a pointer to
 * it. process and done then get that pointer passed back to them.
 *
 * process is called when the main program wants to process a(nother)
 * packet. It is passed the the cookie from init, the buffer pointer,
 * the packet length, the OUT it should put the results into, and some
 * flag bits.
 *
 * done is called to clean up before exiting. This is not, strictly,
 * necessary, since exiting cleans up most things. This exists both
 * in case there is something (like a temporary file in the
 * filesystem) that needs more cleaning up and to make it easier to
 * wrap this code in things that don't just exit when they're done.
